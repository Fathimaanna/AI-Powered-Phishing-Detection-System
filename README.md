  AI-Powered Phishing Detection System

This project is a *Machine Learning-based Phishing Detection System* developed as part of our *Mini Project*.  
It identifies whether a given website is *legitimate or phishing* using URL and domain features.



Features
- Detects *Phishing vs Legitimate* websites.  
- Extracts multiple URL/domain-based features like:  
  - URL length  
  - Use of HTTPS  
  - Special symbols (@, //)  
  - Domain age, etc.  
- Uses *AI/ML classification algorithms* for prediction.  
- Provides a simple prediction system for safer browsing.
